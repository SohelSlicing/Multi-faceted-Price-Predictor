The aim of the projet is to make a single website for predicting prize of most frequntly sold products on reselling websites like OLX, Quikr etc. I will be using regression algorithms that provides the best accuracy based on the parameters selected be it multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, Decision tree or Random Forest regression.
I've tried to include All the commonly used features that decide the value of these products. though finding the data on these things is quite challenging and since I haven't learned how to do web scraping i'll be borrowing datasets from kaggle.
The most challening part of this project would be feature extraction and creating a wesite accomodating all these features together. I'll probably use stream lit and python for the backend. Hope this works out, i'll keep updating this as the project goes along. 
So it's been a day since I started the project and i'm at my first challeng. working on the bike dataset, the data is already really good to work with. Its in proper format, there's lots of it meaning greater accuracy. now i wanna create a pipline that'll convert the categorical data using one hot encoder and then apply the regression models to it. i'm getting some errors and now the goal is to hash them out.
